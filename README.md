# Investigating the real-time performance by computing Utilization using ROS
# Abstract
Recent advancements in autonomous vehicles such as delivery robots, maritime and commercial vehicles have resulted in renewed interest in the field of autonomous driving. One of the important aspects
involves quantizing how well the technologies involved in autonomous driving execute and research in
this field has been of vital importance. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is an approach
that enables machines to create maps and understand their location in real-time. Visual SLAM represents
a distinct variant within the realm of SLAM systems, utilizing 3D vision to execute tasks of localization
and mapping even in situations where both the sensorâ€™s location and the surrounding environment remain
unfamiliar The goal of this paper is to document the execution of OV2Slam Algorithm with a subset of
KITTI data and also benchmark the results with boxplots and calculations involved. We also have a look
at the utilization time of a chunk of KITTI data in OV2Slam
